# Jira-word-list-maker
This project automates English vocabulary extraction from transcripts and posts the results as a formatted comment in Jira. The system automatically analyzes the transcript and generates a list of advanced English words with Japanese translations.

##üîÑ Workflow

Trigger ‚Äì A Jira Automation rule sends a webhook (HTTP POST) to an AWS API Gateway endpoint when a Subtask is created or updated.

Processing ‚Äì The API Gateway invokes an AWS Lambda function written in Python. The Lambda securely loads credentials from environment variables.

Transcript Retrieval ‚Äì The Lambda scrapes the English transcript from the TED Talk URL.

Vocabulary Extraction ‚Äì Using the wordfreq library, the system identifies 100 high-difficulty words, ranked by rarity and linguistic complexity.

Translation and Formatting ‚Äì Each word is translated into Japanese via the Google Translate API. Accent positions are marked for easier pronunciation learning.

Jira Comment ‚Äì The vocabulary list is formatted into a Markdown-style table and automatically posted as a comment in the related Jira issue.
